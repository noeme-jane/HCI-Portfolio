<i><b>Welcome!</i></b><br>
This school portfolio contains a coursera certificate, team KEMFET's project files (team logo, parts 1-3, and other related files) , and the "Uplift; U" user manual.

<b>About Uplift;U</b><br>
The Uplift;U application is a digital tool that helps students manage their mental health concerns by providing a comfort space to express themselves. With rising stress, anxiety, and other mental health conditions among students, there is a pressing need for easily available, tailored, and dependable mental health options. This project attempts to meet this need by creating an application that features a variety of stress management activities such as personal journals and communicating with a chatbot to express themselves when they have no one to talk to or avoidant when speaking their thoughts and feelings with others.

<i><b>About Team KEMFET</i></b><br>
